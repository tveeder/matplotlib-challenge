Pymaceuticals Inc., a burgeoning pharmaceutical company based out of San Diego, CA. Pymaceuticals specializes in drug-based, anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In their most recent efforts, they've since begun screening for potential treatments to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

The data are from their most recent animal study. In this study, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time.  Data analysis performed to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare.
